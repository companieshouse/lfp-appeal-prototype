# Appeal a Late Filing Penalty

## About the service
Companies House issues late filing penalties to companies who fail to file their accounts by the due date. Companies are notified of a penalty being issued by a letter sent to the companies registered office.

Companies who receive a penalty may choose to appeal that decision by contacting Companies House. An appeal will only be upheld if it meets a set of valid conditions.

This service that allows users to submit that appeal electronically.
